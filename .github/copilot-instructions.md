# Best Practices for Creating a Model Context Protocol (MCP)

This document provides guidelines and best practices for developing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) service, especially when integrating with APIs and using YAML configuration files.

## 1. Configuration
- Use a clear and well-documented YAML schema for API definitions.
- Validate YAML files before processing to catch errors early.
- Support environment variable interpolation for secrets and endpoints.

## 2. API Integration
- Abstract API calls to allow easy extension and maintenance.
- Handle authentication (API keys, OAuth, etc.) securely and flexibly.
- Implement robust error handling and logging for API requests and responses.

## 3. Modularity
- Structure code into logical modules (e.g., config loader, API client, response handler).
- Allow users to extend or override core functionality via plugins or hooks.

## 4. Security
- Never log sensitive information (API keys, tokens, passwords).
- Sanitize all inputs and outputs.
- Keep dependencies up to date and monitor for vulnerabilities.

## 5. Usability
- Provide clear CLI commands and helpful error messages.
- Document all configuration options and expected YAML structure.
- Include example YAML files and usage scenarios.

## 6. Testing
- Write unit and integration tests for all major components.
- Validate YAML parsing and API interaction in tests.

## 7. Documentation
- Maintain up-to-date documentation in the repository.
- Use README and inline code comments to explain design decisions.

Following these practices will help ensure your MCP is robust, secure, and easy to use and maintain.
